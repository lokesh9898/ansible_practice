If find the below error 
httpd Server not started: (13)Permission denied: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:88

semanage (SELinux Policy Management Tool) is used to configure certain parts of SELinux policy without requiring modification to or recompilation from policy sources.

This post will help you to install the necessary packages for getting semanage command.

Letâ€™s see which package provides us the semanage command using the YUM command.

yum whatprovides semanage

or

yum provides *bin/semanage

Now, install the policycoreutils-python-utils package using the YUM command.

yum install -y policycoreutils-python-utils

Solution
-------

I happened to run into this problem because of missing SELinux permissions. By default, SELinux only allowed apache/httpd to bind to the following ports:

80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000

So binding to my httpd.conf-configured Listen 88 HTTP port and config.d/ssl.conf-configured Listen 8445 TLS/SSL port would fail with that default SELinux configuration.

To fix my problem, I had to add ports 88 and 8445 to my system's SELinux configuration:

    Install semanage tools: sudo yum -y install policycoreutils-python
    Allow port 88 for httpd: sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 88
    Allow port 8445 for httpd: sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8445
